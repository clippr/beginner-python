* ## **Python** is ok I guess
* ## There's really only 3 things to know:

#Variables
* Variables are generally pretty cool
* Assigning variables is super ez. Just do:
```
_a = (1+4)_
```
or whatever to assign a as an integer variable.
Use:
```
_a = (1.0 + 4.0)_
```
 to assign a as a floating point number (do this.)
* You can use these for just about damn near anything.
* If you use an integer when you should have used a floating point you will git some error message probably. (pun intended)
* Variables are used for damn near everything, especially things that change frequently and need to be called to.

#Conditionals
* Conditionals are phrases that rely on the status of something else to function, for example:
```
if x > 1:
    Print "hello"
```
This block of code would only print "hello" if x is greater than 1.
* The block of code above would also be an example of an _expression_, which is any statement that combines values (numbers) and operators (+, -, >, =, ect.)
* Branching offers the ability to incorporate multiple outcomes from a single function, with the use of if/else statements such as the one used above.  For example, the block below will have two different outcomes depending on the value of x.

```
if x >=5:
    Return True
else:
    Return False
```
