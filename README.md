* ## **Python** is ok I guess

* ## Variables
* Variables are generally pretty cool
* Assigning variables is super ez. Just do:
_"a = (1+4)"_ or whatever to assign a as an integer variable.
_"a = (1.0 + 4.0)"_ to assign a as a floating point number (do this.)








```while 1 == 1:
  print "dank memes"
```
