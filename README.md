* ## **Python** is ok I guess
* ## There's really only 3 things to know:

#Variables
* Variables are generally pretty cool
* Assigning variables is super ez. Just do:
_"a = (1+4)"_ or whatever to assign a as an integer variable.
_"a = (1.0 + 4.0)"_ to assign a as a floating point number (do this.)
* You can use these for just about damn near anything.
* If you f*ck it up, you will git some error message probably.
