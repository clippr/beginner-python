####_In unrelated news, many researchers believe that "dank memes" may be the driving factor in the decline of society_

* ## **Python** is ok I guess
* ## There's really only 3 things to know:

#Variables
* Variables are generally pretty cool
* Assigning variables is super ez. Just do:
```
_a = (1+4)_
```
or whatever to assign a as an integer variable.
```
_a = (1.0 + 4.0)_
```
 to assign a as a floating point number (do this.)
* You can use these for just about damn near anything.
* If you use an integer when you should have used a floating point you will git some error message probably. (pun intended)
* Variables are used for damn near everything, especially things that change frequently and need to be called to.

#Conditionals




```

```



```while 1 == 1:
  print "dank memes"
```
